In this training, we will dive into one of the Kaggle "Getting Started" competitions, building all of our code using Nx tooling. With this approach, we will discuss how the libraries complement and interact with each other.

**Training objectives:**

This training is a zero-to-hero course on the Nx ecosystem, with some brushes of Machine Learning as well. We will create a solution for one of the Kaggle "Getting Started" competitions from scratch. Throughout the training we will make the boundaries between the Nx libraries clearer as well.

**Training audience:**
- This training will be interesting both to people who have some experience in ML but want to learn Nx, as well as people who know Elixir and want to see how the Nx libraries fit together. 

**Training prerequisites:**
Participants should make sure they can run EXLA on their machines. Ideally, CUDA should be enabled, but CPU should suffice for the simpler models. The latest Livebook should also be installed.
